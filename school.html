<h1>School<a class="headerlink" href="#school" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>February 1, 2016</p>
<p>To: Josie &amp; Romy</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg begat a baby boy, Max, on December 1st, 2015. In the
public announcement, he also <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-letter-to-our-daughter/10153375081581634">donated about $45 billion to charity</a>.
I unfortunately can&#8217;t bestow $45 billion to the two of you or the
public, but I will donate what every New York parent is rich in: a
general neuroticism surrounding the school system. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#non-rival-good" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>As I write this, your mother and I are in the midst of applying to
kindergarten for Josie. We&#8217;ve broken this into four different
categories: private, public, gifted &amp; talented, and charter.</p>
<p>Private:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Saint Ann&#8217;s</li>
<li>Brooklyn Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>Public:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Brooklyn New School</li>
<li>Children&#8217;s School</li>
<li>PS 133 (Spanish, French, general ed, in that order)</li>
<li>PS 261 (our zoned school)</li>
</ul>
<p>G&amp;T:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PS 38</li>
<li>PS 32</li>
<li>PS 230</li>
</ul>
<p>Charter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Community Roots</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#8217;s get through the easy ones. Your Aunt Allison teaches at
Community Roots, and your mother, who once volunteered there as the
Worm Lady, loves the school. But it&#8217;s not in our district, and so the
chances of either of you getting in by lotto is zero.</p>
<p>PS 38, 32, and 230 are G&amp;T schools. Josie took the test a few weekends
ago, and I asked her if she had fun and wanted to go back another
weekend. She said yes, so I suppose that&#8217;s a good sign. These schools
are pretty decent. 230 is already a highly sought after school, and 38
and 32 are catching up. But as in all G&amp;T, there&#8217;s an uneasy ethnic /
socioeconomic divide. It&#8217;s easy to tell when you walk into a PS 38
classroom if it&#8217;s G&amp;T. I have not yet seen 230, but I&#8217;ve heard the
integration is much better there.</p>
<p>We are not fans of our zoned school, PS 261. While it has a very
distinctive progressive core and administration, it&#8217;s plagued with
problems, both external and self-imposed. It&#8217;s the only school which I
toured that openly talks about its budget problems, of which one
outcome is that there is an occasional science class, and it&#8217;s taught
in Arabic. Learning science once a week in Arabic is a sure way to not
learn any science nor Arabic. Hearing 261&#8217;s principal talk about money
makes me glad I don&#8217;t run a public school. It must be one of the most
challenging and grueling jobs around.</p>
<p>As for what I mean by &#8220;self-imposed&#8221; &#8211; the administration&#8217;s attitude
toward parent questions, as well as their very strong social ideology,
turned us off on the school. It&#8217;s really not for everyone. That said,
I&#8217;m sure that it would be a fine place for both of you, but we&#8217;re
still hoping for a different experience.</p>
<p>PS 133 is an &#8220;up and coming&#8221; school (which is code for gentrifying),
but it does have two strong immersive language programs. I&#8217;m divided
on this. On the one hand, knowing multiple languages is pretty neat,
on the other hand, possibly billions of people around the world know
multiple languages, so it&#8217;s in actuality not really that unusual.</p>
<p>I believe, though, that there are two things that have the most
bearing on the success of the school:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The involvement of the parents, which usually translates into a
strong PTA, but could also mean how bad the parents care about the
school.</li>
<li>The (meritocratic) selectivity of the admissions process.</li>
</ol>
<p>The good news is that #1 is something a school can cultivate, and PS
133 seems to be doing that quite well. The bad news is that an
emphasis on #2 makes it easy to bias towards families with
socioeconomic advantages. I&#8217;m reminded of the recent groundbreaking
study that found kids admitted to Ivy League schools but who attended
state schools do just as well in life (as measured by income, I
believe) as kids who actually went. I am a (possibly weak) example of
this: I was admitted to Cornell but went to Berkeley. What I&#8217;m trying
to get at is the schools themselves might have little effect, but
rather they&#8217;re simply experts at picking out good students. This makes
sense &#8211; universities gain reputation by having top notch researchers,
who are not necessarily good teachers, but who succeed in attracting
the best talent.</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s School is an interesting one. It is a complete Integrated
Co-Teaching school, meaning children with learning disabilities and
general education students are mixed into the same classrooms, for
every classroom. Some schools have one class per grade that is an ICT
class, but <em>all</em> of Children&#8217;s School is like that, which makes it
truly a part of their identity. They have a deep institutional
knowledge of how to teach kids like this, and their belief is that the
kids with the &#8220;disadvantages&#8221; don&#8217;t usually have all around
&#8220;disadvantages&#8221;. They can thrive quite well and can often times
surpass the gen-ed kids in their academic abilities. When I toured, I
met a 5th grade girl who was quite possibly the most socially
impressive 5th grader I have ever met. None of the other schools I
toured had children who were quite as thoughtful, well spoken, and
mature as her. This is why Children&#8217;s School is at the top of my list.</p>
<p>Finally, Brooklyn New School rounds out the public options. BNS is a
chaotic, arts, and curiosity driven environment. Your mother loves
it. When I toured, there were kids just roaming the hallways, artwork
everywhere. I find it a bit too unstructured, but still the school
does well by every measure, has a strong parent community, a
distinctive culture, and very dedicated / fanatical teachers. These
are good signs. Though I like Children&#8217;s School a bit more, we placed
this school at the top of our public school list.</p>
<p>Both of these schools I would say rank high on the &#8220;parents give a
damn&#8221; scale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your chances of getting into either Children&#8217;s School
or BNS are near zero since they are essentially random lotto drawn
from the entire district. Ah, life in the public school system.</p>
<p>As for private schools, I still have a weird hangup about them, as I
think a lot of people who grew up in the public school system
do. However, Saint Ann&#8217;s and Brooklyn Friends are both distinctive in
that they don&#8217;t just prescribe a method of teaching and what children
should know, but they embrace an idea of how children should
<em>be</em>. Ditto BNS and Children&#8217;s School to the extent they can as public
schools beholden to the Common Core. I wrote so much in a letter to
Saint Ann&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>My wife and I both went through pretty intensive academic
careers. She has a PhD. I’m the least educated in my family — my
father has a PhD, my brother a PhD, and my mom a masters. I spent my
childhood surrounded by university professors. The ethnic culture I
grew up in strongly values academic rigor, but not necessarily
academic joyfulness. I lucked out in that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastside_High_School_(Gainesville,_Florida)">my public high school</a>
valued both rigor and joy. In touring public, private, and charter
schools for Josie, I’ve found some that focus on rigor, some on joy,
but none really do rigor and joy well except Saint Ann’s. The
freewheeling intellectualism and independence of Saint Ann’s student
body is an experience that we’d love to provide for our children.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I read a story about Joseph Campbell that has
never left me. At Sarah Lawrence, he apparently had the habit of
assigning half a dozen books to read per week to his students. At
one lecture, one of his students stood up and confronted him about
the work load, pointing out that everybody had other courses to deal
with as well. Campbell laughed and said “I’m surprised you even
tried to read these books. You have the rest of your life to do
that.” Saint Ann’s seems to embody that ethos more than any other
school I’ve seen.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As for Brooklyn Friends, we really appreciate the Quaker philosophy
and temperament. The high school is also an International
Baccalaureate school like mine, which again prescribes how students
should be, not just what students should know. The IB program was a
formative experience for me, more difficult than Berkeley in some
ways, and I would be thrilled if the two of you had the same
opportunity.</p>
<p>Saint Ann&#8217;s is our favorite between the two private schools, but both
are great.</p>
<p>It feels weird to be picking a school for the two of you that you may
be at for the next 13 years, but this is what happens in NYC and this
is why parents are neurotic. And if we don&#8217;t opt for private, then
we&#8217;re looking at going through this process two more times, as well as
insane overcrowding and budget problems where we live. Some of the
biggest and best schools near us (PS 58) have started rejecting
in-zone children because they don&#8217;t have space, and developers are
somehow able to get by building higher and higher without helping
alleviate pressure on the schools. This is the problem with
residential real estate in NYC: there is no alignment between
developers and the long term interests of residents. The developers
get money when a unit sells, but the residents deal with lack of
schools long past the point the builders are out of the
picture. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#future-stream" id="id4">[2]</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re fortunate that we have the ability to send you to a place for
essentially a boutique education. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#finances" id="id5">[3]</a> I think if I were able
to look at your career outcomes for each of these options, they would
look largely the same. But what your mother and I are hoping to get
out of school is something more than just a good job. I find it rare
for adults to truly want to continue learning, and truly <em>know</em> how to
continue learning. Of course everybody believes they keep learning,
but everybody also believes they are right and just, and we know there
are plenty of people who are not. Our task is to ensure you will
forever make forward progress.</p>
